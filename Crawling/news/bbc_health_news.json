This is the story of those fighting for compensation.Watch on iPlayerBut something dramatic has happened since the pandemic. There have been more than double the number of claims under the VDPS for Covid jabs than during the previous four decades for all other vaccines combined.Since the pandemic there have been almost 16,000 claims against Covid vaccines and 180 awards.

This can cause damage in the brain and to multiple other organs.Platelets are cells that help your blood clot, and it was so unusual to see blood clots combined with low platelet levels, that experts coined a new medical term: vaccine-induced thrombosis with thrombocytopenia, or VITT.These were so unusual that the signal was not seen in the clinical trials of the vaccine involving more than 23,000 participants, but only once the jab had started being rolled out across Europe and given to millions.In mid-March 2021, a dozen European countries briefly suspended use of the AstraZeneca jab while the clots link was investigated.Then, in April that year, the UK restricted the vaccine to the over-30s, and a month later to the over-40s because it became clear that younger people were at higher risk from the clots.Several other European countries, when they",

We continue to invest in our fuel voucher and discretionary assistance schemes to help people in crisis with fuel costs.\"Gareth Davies says the first minister's response is \"not going to wash, as 30,000 people in Conwy and Denbighshire will lose their winter fuel payments this year, with both set to become the hardest-hit counties in the United Kingdom as a result of this callous decision by the UK Labour government\". From this winter, most pensioners will lose the winter fuel payment unless they are receiving certain benefits such as pension credit, which is widely under-claimed.Image source, PA MediaShareclose panelShare pageCopy linkAbout sharingDisasters Emergency Committeepublished at 13:58 British Summer Time 22 October13:58 BST 22 OctoberRegarding the ongoing situation in the Middle East, the first minister says",

Ms McCleery had developed a complication known as shoulder dystocia, which means the baby becomes stuck during the final stages of labour.The inquest heard the boy's stillborn death had been foreseeable and preventable.Ms McCleery said the \"extensive\" report was great to see and it was clear that things were not what they should be.However, on the issue of midwife-led units, she said the lack of immediate medical intervention meant mothers and babies were at further risk in emergencies.Getty ImagesThe review looked into care for mothers and babies in Northern IrelandProf Renfrew, who spoke to women, families and staff, said her review was aimed at ensuring women, babies and families receive safe, equitable and quality maternal care.Some women suffered what she described as unacceptable experiences which contributed to physical and emotional harm, sometimes causing long-lasting distress.\"We also heard from women",

In an opinion piece for the Telegraph, the health secretary wrote: \"Widening waistbands are also placing significant burden on our health service.\"\"The long-term benefits of these drugs could be monumental in our approach to tackling obesity.\"The NHS's latest Health Survey for England shows in 2022, 29% of adults in England were obese and 64% were deemed to be overweight. Illnesses relating to obesity cost the NHS \u00a311bn a year, Streeting said.  Obesity has also been linked to the development of type 2 diabetes, with the NHS spending around \u00a310bn a year - 9% of its budget - to care for people with diabetes.

Speaking to the Today programme, she said the plans look at people based on \"their potential economic value\" rather than their needs.Some weight loss medicines are already prescribed by the NHS. The medication which supresses appetite is sold under the brand names Wegovy - used to treat obesity - and Ozempic, for diabetes.It comes in the form of an injection and mimics the hormone GLP-1, making people feel fuller and less hungry.Experts have warned in the past that the drug is not a quick fix or a replacement for eating well and exercising, and should only be offered under medical supervision.Former health minister Lord Bethell said the NHS would have to make \"concrete steps to pivot to prevention so that we\u2019re not simply medicalising the national obesity problem.\"Amanda Pritchard, the chief executive of the NHS, said the drugs would be a \"game-changer\" for public health and could reduce the risk of diabetes, heart attacks and strokes.

While she had previously had a benign lump, she booked an appointment with a GP and said her life then \"changed for a little while\". \"One of the bizarre things was I almost knew before they spoke,\" she said. \"The breast cancer nurse had come in with a surgeon.\"I knew a breast cancer nurse wouldn't come in without the diagnosis being what it is.\"I heard some words but I didn't really take everything in.\"This is from someone who understands the terminology - I know what it means but it still was not really going in.\"'Like going through the menopause again'The cancer had spread to her lymph nodes in May 2022 and by September of the same year she started chemotherapy and then radiotherapy treatment. \"It was fairly horrible quite",

Her family said after she was eventually taken to Royal Derby Hospital, she was given a bed in \"a corridor\" for 23 hours.East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) and University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust (UHBD) have apologised directly to her family.They say they were told to expect an ambulance within four hours on 2 October and that they should not move her.

At the same time, the medication is being given to mice to see what effect it has on Alzheimer's.Prof Hooper asked the rhetorical question: \"Would we potentially get the nerve cells to stop degenerating, or even regenerate?\"Probably the best we could look for is that we prevent things getting worse.\"Ultimately, however, he said he hoped \"if we got the right mix of treatments, maybe we could regenerate [ACE2], at least to some extent.\"What are the symptoms of dementia?memory lossreduced mental sharpness and quicknessdifficulties with language, such as using words incorrectly, or finding it hard to speakreduced levels of understanding and/or judgementdifficulties with movement and doing daily activitiesSource:",

Parents and doctors will spot something wrong with a child\u2019s development but discovering the cause - the specific mutation in our entire genetic code - is often elusive.Jaydi\u2019s mum Lisa Hawker says she first knew something was wrong when a pregnancy anomaly scan highlighted unusual brain development.Jaydi was born at 31 weeks, weighing just 2lbs (0.9kg) and continued to grow and develop slowly.\u201cShe was so tiny, smaller than a doll, even dolls' clothes were too big,\u201d says the single mum from Seaton, in Devon.Jaydi left hospital only a week before her first birthday.Lisa HawkerJaydi was fed via a nasogastric tube to provide food and liquid into her stomach\"She just wasn\u2019t putting on weight despite having tube feeds, extra calories, and also her development was delayed and we just didn\u2019t know what was going on,\" says Dr Emma Kivuva, clinical geneticist at the Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust.A genetic disorder was suspected but no amount of testing confirmed it.Lisa says: \u201cIt was not knowing why she wasn\u2019t growing,",

Did I not eat enough or drink enough or wait too long in life? And just driving yourself crazy not knowing.\u201dListen: Jaydi's story on Inside Health on BBC SoundsWhen Jaydi was nearly one, Dr Kivuva offered a place on the Deciphering Developmental Disorders study. The largest ever study of children with genetic disorders, it is a collaboration between the NHS, universities and the Sanger Institute, which specialises in analysing DNA.Years later it would provide answers but initially Lisa and Jaydi had to navigate the uncertainties of an unknown condition. \u201cShe\u2019d been in hospital for so long she didn\u2019t even know I was her mum, she\u2019d been handled by so many nurses for so long,\" says Lisa, who even tried playing hospital sounds to soothe her daughter.Jaydi learned to walk and started nursery but she is non-verbal and has problems seeing and hearing.Lisa says at one point \"the whole side of her face had collapsed\" and doctors thought she would need major reconstructive surgery to relieve pressure on her brain.

It is caused by a mutation that affects the body\u2019s ability to repair DNA damage and had only been documented a handful of times before.\u201cThe penny dropped, it all made sense,\u201d says Lisa.The diagnosis connected the primordial dwarfism, the development delays and what was happening in her blood.For Lisa, the diagnosis ended years of searching for an answer. For clinicians, it meant they could compare Jaydi\u2019s notes with other cases of lig4 from around the world. \u201cAs doctors, particularly at a time we were trying to understand her bone marrow tests, it meant we had an explanation and knew what to do about it,\u201d said Dr Kivuva.Children with lig-4 syndrome were at an increased risk of aggressive and hard to treat leukaemia.Rather than wait for that to happen, Lisa and doctors agreed an immediate bone marrow transplant could save Jaydi's life. It involved Jaydi and Lisa staying in a sterile room for six months because of the risk of infection but Lisa says it was worth it.She says: \"The bloods are all back to normal, she\u2019s back to school, she\u2019s running round like a crazy child and she\u2019s really happy and healthy at the moment.\"I think if we hadn\u2019t got that",

A separate bill is already under discussion in Scotland.Opponents have raised concerns including the possibility of people being put under pressure to end their lives. Campaign group Care Not Killing said the government should focus on improving palliative care instead.What are assisted dying, assisted suicide and euthanasia?There is some debate over exactly what the various terms mean.However, assisted dying generally refers to a person who is terminally ill receiving lethal drugs from a medical practitioner, which they administer themselves.Assisted suicide is intentionally helping another person to end their life, including someone who is not terminally ill. That could involve providing lethal medication or helping them travel to another jurisdiction to die. Euthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a person's life to relieve suffering in which a lethal drug is administered by a physician. Patients may not be terminally ill. There are two types: voluntary euthanasia, where a patient consents; and non-voluntary, where they cannot because, for example, they are in a coma. NHS: Euthanasia and assisted suicideNHS: End of life careAre assisted dying, assisted suicide or euthanasia legal in the UK?Throughout the UK, laws prevent people from asking for medical help to die.

More than 200 doctors and specialists have now written to the health secretary to say how stretched NHS obesity treatment services face unprecedented demand from patients wanting these drugs.They warn the injections are only part of what should be a wider package of non-stigmatising care. Why weight-loss drugs may be no obesity silver bulletThey say the government must fix some fundamentals issues in NHS obesity services - chronic underfunding, workforce challenges and unequal access to care. The letter to Wes Streeting is being sent by the Obesity Health Alliance (OHA), which represents health charities and medical royal colleges, and has compiled a report.It says some patients can wait up to five years for specialist support, and that some services are so overstretched they have closed their waiting lists entirely.The OHA wants to see equitable access for obesity treatments, including weight loss injections.There have been reports of global stock shortages and, currently in the UK on the NHS, the injections can only be offered through specialist weight-management services. Some patients go private, but many others miss out, warns the OHA. According to the OHA, about four million people in England are eligible for Wegovy, but NHS projections estimate that by 2028, fewer than 50,000 people a year would get the treatment.

Patients must still exercise and watch what they eat.Users can put weight back on once they stop the medication. And, as with any drug, there can be side effects.Doctors are concerned about the growing numbers of patients they are seeing with complications from taking weight loss drugs bought online without clinical supervision.In many cases people might not actually be getting what they think they are, which can be very dangerous.Public health measures to help prevent obesity problems in the first place, such as improving the nation's diet and helping children get enough exercise, are also vital, says the OHA.

A spokesman for Health Innovation Manchester, which is running the study for US Pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, said: \"This is not about getting unemployed people back to work\".

She said the main obstacles for those out of work was a \"tick-box\" model at the job centre which meant those with specific needs could not get support. \"To be honest it\u2019s not something that presents as a barrier to employment, unlike mental health, digital exclusion, living in poverty or insecure housing\", Mr Green said. \"We support residents with multiple-barriers, when they tell us what\u2019s standing in their way it\u2019s those issues\" and not obesity, he said.

Most of the initiatives in those 10 states would allow abortion until foetal viability, which is generally considered about 24 weeks, or later only in instances when the health of the pregnant woman is at risk. The efforts are a response to the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v Wade, which led many states to enact abortion restrictions or bans. Pro-choice advocates hope that by having voters directly decide to enshrine abortion in states' laws, they can bypass the ups and downs of state courts.But there's another reason why some want abortion on the ballot - voter turnout.Democrats hope that more people who support abortion rights, who overwhelmingly vote for the party, will show up on election day because the issue is on the ballot.Here's what each state will ask voters.ArizonaWhat's the law now? Abortions in Arizona are currently legal until the 15th week of pregnancy. After this point, the law makes an exception for the procedure to save a mother's life, but not for rape or incest.What's on the ballot?A question on whether to amend the state constitution to protect the right to abortion up to foetal viability, or about the 24th week of pregnancy.

But Katarina White, from Arizona Right to Life, said it presents an opportunity for Republicans to court the state's Latino population, as polls suggest a proportion of those voters oppose abortion on religious grounds, but tend to vote Democrat otherwise.NebraskaWhat's the law now? Abortion is illegal after the 12th week of pregnancy in Nebraska except in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is threatened. What's on the ballot?Nebraska is the only state that will have two competing ballot initiatives this November. The first one would enshrine the right to an abortion in the state constitution until foetal viability or later to protect the health of the mother. The second one would enshrine the current 12-week abortion ban into the state's constitution with some exceptions including incest, rape and to save the life of the pregnant woman. How could this affect the election?The competing ballot initiatives could boost turnout in the state, but it is unlikely to change the outcome of other races. Nebraska also has a paid family leave initiative on the ballot, and Ms Lake said both questions could bring more voters out to the polls. NevadaWhat's the law now?

What's on the ballot?A question on whether to enshrine access to abortion in the state's constitution. In order for the protection to be added to the constitution, the ballot question will need to be approved by voters twice: once in 2024 and once in 2026. How could this affect the election?Nevada is one of the most hotly-contested swing states in the election. If more Nevadans show up to the polls and are motivated to vote on this question, it could prove helpful for Democrats.FloridaWhat's the law now? Abortion is currently illegal after six weeks of pregnancy, except in some cases. If an individual wants to have an abortion before the six week mark Florida requires two in-person visits to a clinic, 24 hours apart. There are some exceptions to these regulations, including rape, incest and human trafficking but those only apply up until 15 weeks of pregnancy. Abortions in Florida can also be provided after six weeks if a woman's life is at stake, she faces \"substantial and irreversible\" physical impairment or if there is a fatal foetal abnormality.

Here, the initiative is to amend the state's equal rights amendment to include protections against discrimination due to pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes and reproductive healthcare. The word \"abortion\", however, is not included in the ballot question.

Single-use vapes had been due to be banned in Scotland from April of next year - but the Scottish government has said the ban will now be delayed until 1 June to align with England and Wales.The Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (Defra) said vape usage in England had grown by more than 400% between 2012 and 2023, with 9% of the British public now buying and using the products.The number of people who vape without ever having smoked has also increased considerably over recent years, driven mostly by young adults.It is illegal to sell any vape to anyone under 18, but disposable vapes - often sold in smaller, more colourful packaging than refillable ones - are a \"key driver behind the alarming rise in youth vaping\", the previous government said when it first set out its plan.Public health minister Andrew Gwynne said banning disposables would \"reduce the appeal of vapes to children and keep them out of the hands of vulnerable young",

Single-use vapes are difficult to recycle and typically end up in landfill, where their batteries can leak harmful waste like battery acid, lithium, and mercury into the environment, the government said. Batteries thrown into household waste also cause hundreds of fires in bin lorries and waste-processing centres every year. Defra estimates almost five million single-use vapes were either littered or thrown into general waste each week last year, a nearly four-fold increase on the year before.In 2022, vapes were discarded containing a total of more than 40 tonnes of lithium, enough to power 5,000 electric vehicles, it said.Defra minister Mary Creagh, whose role focuses on reducing waste in the economy, said disposable vapes were \"extremely wasteful and blight our towns and cities\".Paediatric respiratory consultant Dr Claire Hogg told BBC Radio 5 Live that disposables had \"lead to an absolute epidemic of nicotine addiction and a group of children... who are having disrupted sleep, disrupted",

It will cover all single-use vapes, regardless of where they are imported from.Online shops and major retailing platforms will be expected to use \"online takedown procedures\" to stop illicit suppliers when the ban comes into force, the department for health and social care said.The devolved governments have previously announced an intention to bring in similar bans, and the UK government said it was working with them to align the dates on which the bans come into force. Welsh Deputy First Minister Huw Irranca-Davies said introducing the bans on the same date across the nations would enable \"high levels of compliance and consistent approach to enforcement across the UK\".The measure is separate from government plans to end smoking by banning the sale of cigarettes to anyone born after January 2009. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said on Monday a bill to enact that ban would be introduced to parliament before Christmas.

'Out of respect'The coroner said the first inquest the former surgeon was expected to give evidence at would be that of Chloe Nikitas, which takes place at Birmingham and Solihull Coroner's Court on Tuesday. The disgraced surgeon was found to have carried out unnecessary and unapproved procedures on more than 1,000 breast cancer patients over 14 years.His controversial \"cleavage-sparing procedures\" meant cancerous breast tissue was left behind in many patients, while others had operations they did not need.More than 560 patient deaths have been considered so far by a multi-disciplinary team of medical experts, leading to the opening of 62 inquests.The coroner said Paterson was no longer required to provide generic evidence, which concerned his clinical practice, until a later stage of the process.

He said it was obvious being a serving prisoner affected his ability to prepare and instruct his legal team. \"I can and will make every allowance for that,\" he said. Last week Paterson's move to an open prison was cancelled following a risk assessment. He had been due to transfer from a Category C to a Category D prison. The move had sparked anger among his victims and their families, with one describing it as a \"kick in the guts\".But the Ministry of Justice said in a communication seen by the BBC it was rescinded after a change in the prisoner's risk assessment.

It features reports about news, entertainment and sport. (A report is a piece of news about something.)All the presenters have a learning disability or autism. They speak more slowly than on normal TV news shows.They look at issues affecting people with learning disabilities, but they also cover big events and issues like climate change. (To cover something is when a reporter does a news report about it.)Between 4,000 and 5,000 people watch TV BRA every week.What\u2019s it like to work at TV BRA?This is Emily Ann Riedel. She is a reporter for TV BRA. She has Downs Syndrome.Emily says: \u201cI love being a reporter, so that is what I am \u2013 I am a reporter!\u201dEmily has to wear make-up when she goes on camera.

This has created a new set of problems for the state.And then with this, comes a more existential conundrum for Gen Z. What if a large swathe of this generation is permanently semi-detached from the jobs market? Economists call this \u201chysteresis\u201d, where joblessness begets more of it. And could this same generation also be at the sharp end of the explosion of AI replacing a wide set of entry-level jobs - in call centres, retail, law, the financial and creative industries and much more.

France, Norway and Denmark saw modest increases with the latter at 13%, but in the UK, the increase in health-related benefit claimants is an astonishing 30%.The IFS\u2019s deep dive on the claimant statistics reveals that claimants were younger and their claims increasingly focused on mental health. New awards made to under-40s more than doubled from 4,500 a month before the pandemic to 11,500 last year. Over the same time period, the percentage of all new awards primarily for mental health conditions went from 28% to 37%, an increase from 3,900 claims a month to 12,100 a month.A separate report from the OBR this month showed that more than 1 in 13 of the British working-age population will be in receipt of incapacity benefits, another all-time high, reversing a steady decline in the early 2000s.

A quarter of a million new claimants are women aged 60-64.The Employment White Paper being worked on by Kendall will merge the national careers service with job centres. The point of this is to make work and jobs their primary function, rather than acting primarily as the means to prove qualification for benefits. A more personalised service would, for example, offer very different help for women in their 60s to what is offered for Gen Z.The stresses of Britain\u2019s declining health has already been felt in job centres. At one in Sparkhill, Birmingham, front-of-house team leader Qamar Zaman greets jobseekers and explains how the pattern of claims has changed.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of mental health, depression and anxiety\u2026 It's presented by the claimant himself, who comes in and states \u2018look I\u2019ve got a health condition\u2019 and provides a fit note.

And yet at the same time, small businesses might have to pay for higher National Insurance contributions and more generous sick pay, among other stronger workers\u2019 rights brought in by Labour.Every answer to the tougher question about whether this sort of change requires more stick than carrot is for now parried by Kendall. Yes she wants that \u00a363bn forecast cost of health related benefits to \u201ccome down\u201d. But the government is focused on what it sees as the \u201cwin-win\u201d.

The long-term cost of that would be \u00a33bn a year.It is in this department that the most controversial cut has been handled. Kendall says the point of means-testing the winter fuel payment is to focus help on the very poorest, including through increased take up of pension credits from around 880,000 people who don\u2019t currently claim it.The big picture here is that money is tight and increasingly being soaked up into health-related claims. The government\u2019s immediate Budget answer will be that part of the problem is a challenge in the NHS with long waits for appointments for mental health issues and back problems.

This week, the new Labour government suggested they could be a tool to help obese people in England off benefits and back into work.That announcement - and the reaction to it - has held a mirror up to our own personal opinions around obesity and what should be done to tackle it.Here are some questions I\u2019d like you to ponder.Is obesity something that people bring on themselves and they just need to make better life choices? Or is it a societal failing with millions of victims that needs stronger laws to control the types of food we eat?Are effective weight-loss drugs the sensible choice in an obesity crisis? Are they being used as a convenient excuse to duck the big issue of why so many people are overweight in the first place?How do drugs like Wegovy and Mounjaro work?NHS needs better plan around weight loss jabs, warn expertsWhy weight-loss drugs may be no obesity silver bulletPersonal choice v nanny state; realism v idealism \u2013 there are few medical conditions that stir up such heated debate.I can\u2019t resolve all those questions for you - it all depends on your personal views about obesity and the type of country you want to live in.

Gluttony is one of Christianity\u2019s seven deadly sins.Now, let\u2019s look at Semaglutide, which is sold under the brand name Wegovy for weight loss. It mimics a hormone that is released when we eat and tricks the brain into thinking we are full, dialling down our appetite so that we eat less.What this means is that by changing only one hormone, \u201csuddenly you change your entire relationship with food\u201d, says Prof Giles Yeo, an obesity scientist at the University of Cambridge.And that has all sorts of implications for the way we think about obesity.It also means for a lot of overweight people there is a \u201chormonal deficiency, or at least it doesn\u2019t go up as high\u201d, argues Prof Yeo, which leaves them biologically more hungry and primed to put on weight than someone who is naturally thin.That was likely an advantage 100 or more years ago when food was less plentiful \u2013 driving people to consume calories when they are available, because tomorrow there may be none.Our genes have not profoundly changed in a century, but the world we live in has made it easier to pile on the pounds with the rise of cheap and calorie-dense foods, ballooning portion sizes and towns and cities that make it easier to drive than walk or cycle.These changes took off in the",

And it came with huge costs, including the price of the drug and monitoring for significant side-effects such as brain swelling and brain bleeds. People do not get better on donanemab. It is not a cure for Alzheimer's disease, but it slows the progression of the disease. It works by clearing a sticky protein from the brain - called amyloid - which is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's.Donanemab was one of a pair of drugs to generate huge excitement because they were the first to show that Alzheimer's could be slowed down in trials. Earlier today, the drug was approved and given a licence by the safety regulator, the MHRA, which means it can be prescribed privately. But this doesn't mean it can automatically be offered free on the NHS. The NHS does not have a cap on how much it can spend on a drug - it pays for some therapies that cost more than a million pounds.Whether or not a drug is given the green light depends on how big a difference it makes - the more effective and transformative the drug, the more the NHS is willing to pay.The health spending body NICE has ruled the drug would not be a good use of taxpayers' money and was five-to-six times more expensive than the NHS normally considers acceptable.It said donanemab",

In the US it has an official price of around \u00a325,000 a year per patient. However, that is just the cost of the drug. Surrounding care - including an infusion every four weeks and checking for side-effects - significantly adds to the bill.It is estimated that around 70,000 adults in England would have been eligible for treatment with donanemab. Wales and Northern Ireland normally adopt NICE decisions on drugs while a separate body makes recommendations in Scotland.The decision to reject the drug was made despite potential savings to the NHS and social care being considered. Will the NHS ever pay for the new era of dementia drugs?The drug is not free of risk. Brain swelling was a common side-effect in up to a third of patients in the donanemab trial.

However, two volunteers, and possibly a third, died as a result of dangerous swelling in the brain.It means people need genetic testing before they are allowed to go on the drug and regular monitoring while being given donanemab.NICE also said the drug could only be used for 18 months and the impact beyond that was uncertain.Another drug to slow Alzheimer's - lecanemab - was found to be too costly for the NHS in the summer.Prof Fiona Carragher, from the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, said these drugs offered a \"new horizon of hope in the fight against dementia\".She described the decision as \"disheartening\" but said the organisation respected the decision not to fund it on the NHS. Prof Tara Spires-Jones, the president of the British Neuroscience Association, said: \u201cWhile people living with dementia and their loved ones will undoubtedly be disappointed by the decision not to fund this new treatment on the NHS, the good news that new treatments can slow disease even a small amount is hopeful.\" Hilary Evans-Newton, from Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, said: \"Today\u2019s announcement marks another frustrating setback for people affected by Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \"Dementia remains the UK\u2019s leading cause of death, and without action, an ageing population means more families will be affected, driving up NHS costs through emergency admissions and care.\"First drug to slow Alzheimer\u2019s too costly for NHSWhat is Alzheimer's and how common is",

There may be no signs or symptoms for years and some people never develop any problems from it.But in others, the cancer can be aggressive and deadly.Prostate cancer that's detected early has the best chance for successful treatment.Getty ImagesHow common is prostate cancer?One in eight men will get prostate cancer at some point in their lives, says Prostate Cancer UK. It is most common in older age - among men over 75. Cases in the under-50s are rare.Your risk of prostate cancer is higher if you have a close relative - a father, brother, grandfather or uncle - who has had prostate cancer.It is also more common in black men.Prostate Cancer UK has a 30-second online risk checker.

It can go up if there is an infection, for example. And some men with a raised PSA may have a prostate cancer that would not have caused problems or needed treatment, causing unnecessary worry and further investigations.Researchers have repeatedly looked at whether it would be beneficial to introduce the screening.

The size of the new hospital has also been a concern, with discussions nationally about whether the need for overnight rooms would be smaller, because people operated on would go home the same day.It is good it will be bigger, but there is an ageing population and many are concerned mistakes from the past could be repeated.Queen Elizabeth HospitalAn artist's impression of the new muti-storey car parkThe existing hospital was having continuous work done to it to make sure the building was safe.Asked if replacing the hospital could wait until 2030, Mr Brooks said: \"We have to believe it will be safe right up to that moment.\"Some",

The 65-year-old has called on Health Secretary Wes Streeting to change the policy preventing homecare teams like his from entering hospitals, saying it was continuing to put his life \"at high risk\".

Both had advanced dementia.'Idyllic childhood'The two women lived in a specialist dementia unit on the top floor of the 61-bedroom Ridgeway Lodge.Sheila Hartman had been there for about three years. She moved in after struggling on her own at home. Before then the great-grandmother had been a keen walker and loved knitting and making things, the inquest heard.Her son, Richard Uridge said: \"She was a loving mum and we had an idyllic childhood, but practical would be the one single word I think I would use for her.\"Family photoBefore her health deteriorated, Mrs Hartman had been a",

She said she seemed to like the move but was confused by the other people she thought were living in her house.There were just two members of staff on duty on the top-floor dementia unit for the night shift running into 2 October 2022.

She said concern grew when she realised her symptoms were not unlike those experienced by her late father before he died from a brain tumour.While an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan ruled out the possibility that Maria had a brain tumour, a neurologist diagnosed her as having suffered a small cerebellar stroke.\"Looking back over the course of 12 months there were lots of tiny incidents.

Sir Keir told the BBC it was time to \u201cthink differently\u201d. He was speaking after it was announced a trial would be run by Health Innovation Manchester, a research group linked to the NHS, and drug firm Eli Lilly to see if the weight loss drug Mounjaro could help get obese people back into work.Obesity is, without doubt, a major burden on the health service and wider economy.Obesity-related illness costs the NHS an estimated \u00a311bn a year \u2013 about 8% of its spending. Add in lost productivity, and research has shown it costs the economy nearly \u00a3100bn a year \u2013 or 4% of gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of all the economic activity in the country.Quick fixSo it is understandable there is huge hope these drugs could be the answer.After all, the search for a solution to expanding waistlines has eluded successive governments since the early 1990s.Promoting healthy lifestyles, improving food labelling, restricting advertising and taking steps to increase the cost of unhealthy foods, such as the sugar tax, have all been tried - but rates of obesity have continued to rise and one in four adults is now obese.Critics say governments have not gone far enough with these initiatives, while pointing out public health spending has been squeezed in",

And it is only allowed to be given under the supervision of specialist weight loss programmes, access to which is like many NHS services constrained.Mounjaro, meanwhile, is not yet being used by the NHS as a weight-loss treatment - although, the official drugs-advisory body has proposed it should be. The criteria look likely to be similar, with the exception it may be made available more widely in the community, without the need for specialist supervision.And how that can be achieved remains to be seen - as patients still need to follow a structured programme of diet and exercise alongside the treatment. GPs are worried they do not have the capacity to oversee this - and so a range of options are still being explored.  And the NHS has warned it could take years for Mounjaro to be rolled out.There is also concern the drugs could encourage a",

Shortages of Wegovy and Ozempic, the version of semaglutide used for diabetes, have been reported by NHS clinics, thought partly due to a boom in demand on the private market, driven by celebrities endorsing their use as the \"skinny jab\". Although Novo Nordisk, which makes the drugs, said there should be plentiful supply of Wegovy as it has established a protected supply for the NHS.And then in terms of the rising numbers of people out of work because of illness, the role of obesity is complex to work out. The numbers not working because of ill health have risen since the pandemic, hitting 2.8 million last year.But data from the Office for National Statistics shows the most common primary factors are mental health problems and musculoskeletal conditions, affecting the joints, bones and muscles.

Council leader Mark Hunter said the century-old hospital's condition was \"beyond a joke\" and it was \"disappointing\" to see funding requests turned down due to financial constraints. A Department for Health and Social Care spokeswoman said the government recognised the importance of investment to \"get the NHS back on its feet\".  \"As well as vital reform, we will ensure the NHS has the funding it needs as we build a health service fit for the future,\" she added.More than half of the hospital, originally built in 1905 as the Stepping Hill Poor Law Hospital, is in need of major repair, according to a recent structural report. Below standardThe necessary repairs have been priced in the region of \u00a3134m.But health minister Karin Smith said the government could not afford to help fund the repairs due to the \"constrained\" position of public funds.She responded to a letter by local Lib Dem MPs Tom Morrison and Lisa Smart, urging the government to step in.Hunter said the poor state of the hospital had been an issue for Stockport for some time. \"We\u2019ve all been through Stepping Hill, it's hard to find anyone who has not been grateful of their care, but the fabric of the building is beyond a joke,\" he said. A Lib Dem motion amended by Labour councillors was recently passed",

Following the meeting, Ms Leahy said \"at last, someone in government appears to be listening\" but \"time will tell.\"Streeting said he hoped \"wider learnings for the health system\" were made as part of the inquiry. 'Radical reform'The Lampard Inquiry has looked into at least 2,000 mental health deaths in Essex between 2000 and the end of 2023.Ms Leahy said: \"It is the first successful meeting I have had with any secretary of state to be honest. We've asked him to step in and oversee the inquiry and look into it for us and he said he's going to do that.\"\"I am very hopeful, and to be honest, he is the only secretary of state that has bothered to give us the time of day.\"We feel heard, [but] time will tell.\"She added: \"Now we've got the biggest inquiry ever into the psychiatric system in this country, it has to be done right.\"The families were due to meet with Streeting again in two months.

But review author Prof Paul Turner, an allergy expert at Imperial College London, said passengers should not worry about food being transmitted in the air.\"We didn\u2019t find any evidence that nut particles could travel through the cabin ventilation system on airplanes and cause reactions,\" he said.\"On top of that, the vast majority of people with food allergies don\u2019t react to the smell of food, even if they are allergic to very small amounts.\u201dGetty ImagesPeanuts are the most common food to cause dangerous allergic reactions, known as anaphylaxisAir circulates across the cabin, not through it, and efficient filtering systems remove the vast majority of dust, vapours and food particles from the air passengers breathe, the review says.Air is completely exchanged every three to four minutes during a flight.

The vaccine being trialled is made by Moderna and is an mRNA vaccine. Like the company's Covid jab, it delivers instructions to our immune systems on how to recognise an invasive virus and protect against it by producing antibodies.What's tricky about norovirus is that it's difficult to pin down.\"There is a broad and shifting diversity of genotypes over time\", says Dr Patrick Moore, a GP from Dorset, and chief investigator of the study.So this vaccine contains three of the most common strains of the virus to get the best result possible.There are still many unknowns - for example, how long will protection from it last, how effective will it be and how often will the vaccine need to be updated?Answers to those questions should be answered during the trial, which is a collaboration between the UK Government, the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) and",

But healthcare workers, childcare providers, flight attendants and cruise ship passengers and employees are often affected too.Taking on lot of fluids is the only treatment for norovirus, to avoid becoming dehydrated.Saul Faust, professor of paediatric immunology and infectious diseases at the University of Southampton, said norovirus \"placed a huge burden on healthcare systems\".\"Any infection increases frailty - and in the older population it's difficult to reverse that,\" he said.Mobile units will be used in the trial so that researchers can go",

In the meantime, researchers are focusing on collecting data which shows the vaccine reduces the risk of people becoming ill with norovirus. They will then send this information to the UK regulator to get approval for the jab.Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said norovirus puts the NHS \"under huge strain every winter\".\"The UK is leading the way to develop a world-first vaccine for this vomiting bug,\" he said.Professor Lucy Chappell, chief executive of the NIHR, said the vaccine could make a difference to many people's lives, \"especially our most vulnerable citizens\".'I'm 26 and flu left me in hospital last Christmas'RSV jabs start for pregnant women and older peopleTwo-in-one flu and Covid jab passes advanced trialFirm behind Covid vaccine to set up base in UKModernaHealthVaccinationVirusesRelatedWho can get an NHS Covid jab this autumn?8 Oct 2024HealthTwo-in-one flu and Covid jab passes advanced trial10 Jun 2024HealthCovid jab could be available privately from 20245 Oct",

He returns as a 75-year-old monarch receiving treatment for cancer, towards the end of a year during which he has faced immense personal challenges.His public life has been restrained, restricted by illness.

Semaglutide is also used in the diabetes treatment Ozempic.Both Wegovy and Mounjaro are given as weekly injections via pre-filled pens that can be self-administered into the upper arm, thigh or stomach.They work as an appetite suppressant by mimicking a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).This intestinal hormone is released after eating, and typically makes people feel fuller. Mounjaro also affects another hormone, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), which affects metabolism and helps regulate energy balance. Patients typically start on a low dose which is gradually increased until they reach a higher maintenance dose. People taking these drugs typically start to lose weight within a few weeks. Clinical trials suggest that - when combined with changes to their diet, exercise and behavioural support - Wegovy users could lose more than 10% of their body weight after a year on the treatment.Other trials suggest Mounjaro users might lose even more. But it is difficult to compare the two treatments and, crucially, users of either can put weight back on once they stop treatment.Wegovy, the",

Each year, the NHS in England spends an estimated \u00a31.4bn on treating illnesses associated with living in cold or damp housing, according to building research body BRE. The project, set to start in early 2025 in Merseyside, is said to help develop a framework for similar partnerships between social housing providers and the NHS across the UK. Reports since 2000 have shown that only a half of rented accommodation meets the required standard, with homes having many problems such as damp, mould and poor heating.In 2020, two-year-old Awaab Ishak died as a result of mould in his home in Rochdale.The previous, Conservative government promised \"Awaab's law\" would force social housing landlords in England to fix mouldy properties more quickly - but it was not introduced.Labour's new renters' rights bill would make these requirements compulsory for social and private landlords.'Bridging the gap'The housing information securely shared with the NHS would include details about  a patient's living conditions, accessibility needs and neighbourhood, Prima Group said.

The UK trial is a world first and will measure the impact on the job prospects of up to 3,000 people living with obesity in the Greater Manchester area. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer previously told the BBC the jabs would be \"very helpful\" to people who want and need to lose weight.\"[The drug is] very important for our NHS, because, yes we need more money for the NHS, but we've also got to think differently\".Prof Simon Capewell, an expert in public health at Liverpool University, called the plans \"unethical,\" saying they target people for economic reasons \"rather than prioritising the person\u2019s own interests and health\".Obesity expert Dr Dolly van Tulleken said, besides the \"serious ethical, financial, and efficacy considerations,\" the plans were also unrealistic.The eligible population for this plan was \"in the millions\" with specialist weight management services only able to treat 49,000 per year, Dr Van Tuelleken said.Previous plan \"looking at people, or measuring people based on their potential economic value, rather than primarily based on their needs and their health needs\u201d",

An oral health survey of Kent school children in 2023 revealed a quarter of five year olds already had tooth decay, the Kent Community Health Foundation Trust (KCHFT) said. Tooth decay is the leading cause of hospital admission nationally for children aged five to nine, with 30,000 rotten teeth removed from children in hospitals in 2022/23.KCHFT advanced oral health practitioner, Joanne Downs, said \"The children learn from each other, it really is the best way to help support them with their oral health.\"KCHFT and Kent County Council (KCC) piloted the free school programme in Thanet, Swale, Dartford and Gravesham.Tooth decay is a preventable disease caused by too much sugar in the diet and poor toothbrushing. It can cause pain, stop children from eating, speaking, sleeping and so distract them from learning properly at school. Mark Norman/BBCChildren brush their teeth at school after every lunch breakAt The Oaks infant school in Sittingbourne, children brush with the guidance of their teacher for two minutes with a fluoride toothpaste to help make their teeth stronger.The kit is provided to the school free of charge with each child given their own brush.Karen O\u2019Connor, early years lead at the school, said: \u201cSome parents aren\u2019t doing this at home so that\u2019s part of our job to fill those gaps,  to make sure everybody is having the same opportunities to have good oral",
